# 11.2.1 Exercises

1. What happens if you repeat the above analysis with all diamonds? (Not just all diamonds with two or fewer carats). What does the strange geometry of `log(carat)` vs relative price represent? What does the diagonal line without any points represent?

2. I made an unsupported assertion that lower-quality diamonds tend to be larger. Support my claim with a plot.

3. Can you create a plot that simultaneously shows the effect of color, cut, and clarity on relative price? If there's too much information to show on one plot, think about how you might create a sequence of plots to convey the same message.

4. How do depth and table related to the relative price?
